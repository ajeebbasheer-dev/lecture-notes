# A slash at the beginning of a pattern is relative to the directory where the .gitignore resides
# If the pattern doesnâ€™t start with a slash, it matches files and directories in any directory or subdirectory.
# If the pattern ends with a slash, it matches only directories. All of its files and subdirectories are also ignored.
# To see the pattern is ignored, try `git status` command

# ignore entire build folder at the root.
